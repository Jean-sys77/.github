### BentoML - The Unified Model Serving Framework

[üç± BentoML repo](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML) | [üé® Gallery Projects](https://github.com/bentoml/gallery) | [üìñ Documentation](http://docs.bentoml.org)


BentoML provides high-level APIs for packaging ML models and defining ML Services. From the ML service definition, BentoML allows building versioned archive(aka Bento) capturing all required dependencies, automatically generate HTTP Server and create Docker Image for production-grade deployment.

Key Features:
* Support **multiple ML frameworks** including PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, and [many more](https://docs.bentoml.org/en/latest/frameworks/index.html)
* Support **Adaptive Batching** which dynamically group inference requets into small batches in real-time for better performance
* Build inference graph composed from **multiple models** and execute them in parallel
* **Automatic Docker image** can be generated for production deployment
* Automatically generate REST API spec in **Swagger/OpenAPI** format


### Yatai - MLOps on Kubernetes

[ü¶ÑÔ∏è Yatai repo](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML) | [üë©‚ÄçüöÄ Administrator's Guide](https://github.com/bentoml/yatai/blob/main/docs/sys-admin-guide.md)

Yatai helps ML teams to run BentoML at scale on Kubernetes. It makes it easy for teams to manage all their ML assets in one place and operate large scale model serving workloads on Kubernetes.

* **Bento Registry** - manage all your team's Bentos and Models, backed by cloud blob storage(S3, MinIO)
* **Deployment Automation** - deploy Bentos as auto-scaling API endpoints on Kubernetes and easily rollout new versions
* **Observability** - monitoring dashboard helping users to identify model performance issues
* **CI/CD** - flexible APIs for integrating with your training and CI pipelines


### bentoctl - CLI tool for fast model deployment on cloud platforms

[üöÄ bentoctl source](https://github.com/bentoml/bentoctl)

`bentoctl` supports deploying ML Service created with BentoML into popular cloud services. Support for each cloud platform is captured in its own plugin that can be found below:

Supported platforms:
* [AWS EC2](https://github.com/bentoml/aws-ec2-deploy)
* [AWS Lambda](https://github.com/bentoml/aws-lambda-deploy)
* [AWS SageMaker](https://github.com/bentoml/aws-sagemaker-deploy)
* [Azure Functions](https://github.com/bentoml/azure-functions-deploy)
* [Azure Container Instances](https://github.com/bentoml/azure-container-instances-deploy)
* [Google Cloud Run](https://github.com/bentoml/google-cloud-run-deploy)
* [Google Compute Engine](https://github.com/bentoml/google-compute-engine-deploy)
* [Heroku](https://github.com/bentoml/heroku-deploy)

Custom cloud platform is also supported by customizing deployment logic from the bentoctl [deployment operator template](https://github.com/bentoml/bentoctl-operator-template).
